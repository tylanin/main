<span class="hdr">üåê RESEARCH</span>

<p>My research interests primarily lie in sociolinguistics and phonetics. More specifically, I am interested in how social meaning is produced and perceived through phonetic variation, particularly in prosody. I also work on dialect categorization, multilingualism, and code-switching.</p>

<p>Here are some projects I've been working on:</p>

<!--
<p>I'm working on:</p>

<p>
  <b>Categorization of variability in Singlish</b>
  <p class="info">This study examines how variability in Singlish is categorized, and what prosodic cues are used for these categorizations. Using a perception experiment and listener-driven acoustic analysis, we found that Singlish was associated with more local but less global pitch variability, as well as faster articulation rate, and categorizations were associated with typicality. A follow-up experiment with American listeners showed that they made coarser-grained categorizations, leveraged fewer prosodic cues, and did not demonstrate typicality effects.</p>
</p>

<p>
  <b>Affect and embodiment among dancers</b>
  <p class="info">Drawing from ethnographic observations of a freestyle dance group in Singapore, I examine how phonetic variation is linked with affect and embodiment. This ongoing project aims to theorize a view of embodiment as it pertains to movement, or bodily action through space, and how movement is iconically linked with affect and language, especially with prosody.</p>

<p><h3>Ongoing Projects</h3></p>

<p>
  <b>Rhythmic variation in Singapore English, Mandarin, and English-Mandarin code-switching</b><BR>
  <span class="desc">Honors thesis supervised by A/P Rebecca Starr at the National University of Singapore. This study examines rhythmic variation in Singapore English, Mandarin, and English-Mandarin code-switching and how it patterns according to social variables. The findings showed that the rank of a speaker's secondary school affects rhythm for Mandarin and standard English-Mandarin code-switches, as well as the extent to which a speaker maintained differences between their different codes while code-switching. Manuscript is currently in preparation.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>Linguistic practices of mainland Chinese scholars in Singapore</b><BR>
  <span class="desc">Research project with Dr Luke Lu from the Nanyang Technological University. This project aims to examine the language practices of mainland Chinese scholars who are long-term residents in Singapore (i.e., have stayed here for more than five years) and arrived on SM1 government scholarships. Naturalistic and interview data from informants in English, Mandarin, Teochew, and Cantonese will be analyzed using methods from interactional sociolinguistics and language variation. Data collection in progress.</span>
</p>

<p><h3>Papers</h3></p>
