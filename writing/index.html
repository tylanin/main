<h3>Selected Pieces</h3> 
<BR>

<p>
  <b>👾 How Tencent Cracked Down On A Niche Internet Subculture — <a href="https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-tencent-chinese-internet-giant-cracked-down-niche-internet-subculture/" target="_blank">RICE Media</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">For years, fans translated their favourite Chinese webnovels from Qidian, a Tencent-backed website, into English. Translators even started accepting donations and monetising their work. However, Qidian soon took notice. This is what happens when a giant conglomerate cracks down on a community-run subculture.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>💃 Chinese Idol Survival Shows: The Start of a New ‘Idol Era’ — <a href="https://www.whatsonweibo.com/chinese-idol-survival-shows-the-start-of-a-new-idol-era/" target="new">What's On Weibo</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">Tears, breakdowns in the studio, and the promise of stardom. Survival shows have taken the spotlight in Asia's idol scene in recent years, and China is no exception. Shows have cumulative views in the billions, consistently raking in millions of votes every episode. How else has China tapped on this genre, and will it continue to thrive?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>🦚 Why Singapore is Digging Up Its Few Remaining Cemeteries — <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-singapore-is-digging-up-cemeteries" target="new">Atlas Obscura</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">An endless expanse of grass, rubble, and dirt, Choa Chu Kang Cemetery is the only active cemetery left in land-scarce Singapore. I shadow a Taoist priest as he performs pre-exhumation rituals that prepare the dead for "moving house" and observe a family as they supervise the bones of their ancestors being removed from the earth.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>👂 The Realities of Being a PRC Scholar in Singapore — <a href="https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-realities-prc-scholar-singapore/" target="new">RICE Media</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">Almost every Singaporean is familiar with Chinese scholars. But what else do we know about them, apart from the fact that they are 1) really smart and 2) are on a scholarship? What is it like to leave home at the age of 15, alone and in the midst of puberty? Five Chinese scholars share their stories of home and hope.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>🏃‍♂️ A Newbie Hiker's Introduction to Myanmar — <a href="https://theoutbound.com/tan-yin-lin/a-newbie-hiker-s-introduction-to-myanmar" target="_blank">The Outbound</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">In December 2017, I travelled to Myanmar alone. On a friend's recommendation, I joined a three-day, two-night trek through the countryside. Along the way, I encountered chilli padi fields, cats with no noses, and one of the most beautiful countries I've ever had the privilege of visiting.</span>
