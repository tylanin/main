  <span class="hdr">📝 WRITING</span>

  <p>Here's a link to my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g9RffA3azTGiJiS88r0nLUo8svibFmL9RQw5OaDlTmo/edit?usp=sharing" target="new">CV</a>.</p>  

  <p>Currently, I work with longform features, press releases, copywriting, content writing, blog posts, editing, and other word-related things on a freelance basis.</p>

  <p>Previously, I was with <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/authors/tan-yin-lin" target="_blank">TODAY</a>, <a href="https://kr-asia.com/author/yinlin" target="_blank">KrASIA</a>, and <a href="https://www.ricemedia.co/author/tan-yin-lin/" target="_blank">RICE Media</a>.</p>

  <p>I cover multiple beats, including (but not limited to) culture, tech, current affairs, and sustainability. Apart from Singapore, I also write about Southeast Asia and China. I'm comfortable interviewing profiles in Mandarin and translating between English and Mandarin.</p>

  <p>I have worked with Atlas Obscura, PR Newswire Asia, RADII China, What's On Weibo, and more.</p>

  <p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:tylanin@gmail.com">reach out</a> if you'd like to discuss a project or commission a piece of writing.</p>
  
  <p>And these are some articles I've written:</p>

<p><h3>Selected Pieces</h3></p>

<p>
  <b>🌲 Meet the Scientists Mapping China's Wilderness with Cellphone Data — <a href="https://radiichina.com/beijing-city-lab-china-wilderness/" target="_blank">RADII China</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">China has seen one of the fastest urbanization periods in human history. Its population of city dwellers had swelled from 13% in 1950 to over 60% by the end of 2019 ... That is why a team of Chinese scientists made it their mission to map the last remaining pockets of wilderness within the country—using data from people’s cellphones. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>👾 How Tencent Cracked Down On A Niche Internet Subculture — <a href="https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-tencent-chinese-internet-giant-cracked-down-niche-internet-subculture/" target="_blank">RICE Media</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">Like any other niche Internet subculture, the community has an ecosystem of its own, with histories not usually known by those outside of the community. Yet these histories have surprising parallels: how many times have you heard the phrase “turn your passion into profit”?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>🌱 Why Singapore is Digging Up Its Few Remaining Cemeteries — <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-singapore-is-digging-up-cemeteries" target="new">Atlas Obscura</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">His orange Taoist robes stand out amidst the thousands of gray gravestones; his round face is tan and leathered from years of working in the sun. He is here today to help a group of siblings exhume and relocate the remains of their father, mother, and uncle.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>👂 The Realities of Being a PRC Scholar in Singapore — <a href="https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-realities-prc-scholar-singapore/" target="new">RICE Media</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">Even for the scholars themselves, they’ve rarely had the chance to sit down and reflect on their past eight or nine years in Singapore. Each person has their own story to share; to be honest, I doubt that a single interview is enough to encompass the true breadth of anyone’s experiences.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>🏃‍♂️ A Newbie Hiker's Introduction to Myanmar — <a href="https://theoutbound.com/tan-yin-lin/a-newbie-hiker-s-introduction-to-myanmar" target="_blank">The Outbound</a></b><BR>
  <span class="desc">Armed with spotty mobile data and two hours of sleep at an overpriced motel, I trudged up the slope and finally found it—Eversmile Trekking Services.</span>
