  <span class="hdr">📝 WRITING</span>

  <p>Previously, I was with <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/authors/tan-yin-lin" target="_blank">TODAY</a>, <a href="https://kr-asia.com/author/yinlin" target="_blank">KrASIA</a>, and <a href="https://www.ricemedia.co/author/tan-yin-lin/" target="_blank">RICE Media</a>. I was also a freelance journalist/writer from 2016 to 2021.</p>

  <p>I covered multiple beats, including (but not limited to) culture, tech, current affairs, and sustainability. On top of writing about Singapore, I also wrote about Southeast Asia and China. I'm comfortable interviewing profiles in Mandarin and translating between English and Mandarin. I have worked with multiple formats, such as longform features, press releases, blog posts, whitepapers, and op-eds.</p>

  <p>I have worked with Atlas Obscura, PR Newswire Asia, RADII China, What's On Weibo, Meantime Magazine, and more.</p>
