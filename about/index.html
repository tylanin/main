<span class="hdr">üí¨ ABOUT ME</span>

<p>My first name is Yin Lin (È¢ñÂÆÅ), and my last name is Tan (Èôà). That's me on the right, waiting to get my hair cut in the salon for the first time in three years.</p>

<p>I'm a linguistics research assistant and freelance writer in Singapore who intends to start a PhD some time in the next few years.</p>

<p>I find language fascinating, and so I guess it makes sense that I enjoy learning more about them and how they are used, particularly while interacting with other speakers. My research interests primarily lie in sociolinguistics. Specifically, I focus on multilingualism and issues of language and identity. I also enjoy working with other disciplines, like psychology, semiotics, and computer science.</p> 

<p>On the writing-related side of things, I love working with words and telling stories. I have been freelancing since 2016 and have had multiple stints in the journalism industry. Currently, I take on feature writing, copywriting, content writing, and copy editing jobs on a freelance basis.</p> 

<p>I am fluent in English and Mandarin, used to learn French, and am learning Japanese and Korean.</p>

<p>In my downtime, I can be found at dance (my main genres are house, soul, and hip hop), doing yoga, consuming media, planning my next trip, or dabbling in some vague creative pursuit.</p>
