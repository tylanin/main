<p>The world is exciting. I seek to understand it through honest reporting, insightful analysis, and the power of narrative. I have freelanced for various publications, both Singaporean and non-Singaporean, and have experience writing in different genres.</p>

<p>My broad interests lie in documenting and understanding people, places, and experiences; my specific interests lie mainly in culture, identity, current affairs, and art. I also love travelling and often archive my experiences, <a href="http://verytravelmuchbroke.wordpress.com" target="new">though they arenâ€™t always very linear</a>. In a previous life, I was an aspiring academic; my experience with linguistics research also informs my work today, cultivating in me a keen interest in data interpretation, statistics, language, and society. Currently, I am especially interested in issues related to East Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>I am fluent in English and Mandarin, used to learn French, and am currently learning Japanese and Korean. When not writing, I can be found at dance practice, skateboarding, running, reading a book, planning my next trip, or dabbling in other creative pursuits.</p>
