<h2>About</h2>

<p>I once shared an uncooked crabstick fresh out of the package with a stranger from China along the Black Sea in Ukraine in zero degree weather. Another time, I was almost kidnapped by a 60-year old Serbian man in a (likely stolen) car while trying to hitchhike from Holland to Croatia.</p>

<p>The world is exciting. I seek to understand it through honest reporting, insightful analysis, and the power of narrative. To me, thoughtful journalism is what brings us together and allows us to fully engage with and immerse in our world.</p>

<p>I enjoy the legwork: finding sources, establishing contacts, conducting interviews, and carrying out in-depth research and investigations to help uncover the truth. My broad interests lie in documenting and understanding people, places, and experiences; my specific interests lie mainly in culture, identity, current affairs, and art. I also love travelling and often archive my experiences, though they arenâ€™t always very linear. Currently, I am especially interested in issues related to East Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>I am fluent in English and Mandarin, used to learn French, and am currently learning Japanese and Korean. When not writing, I can usually be found at dance practice, learning to skateboard, reading a book, or planning my next trip.</p>
