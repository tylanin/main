<p>I'm currently an editorial intern at Rice Media and a freelance writer. In a previous life, I was an aspiring linguist.</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>The world is really cool and I try to understand it by writing about stuff that inspires curiosity.</p>

<p>I primarily cover culture, current affairs, and the arts. I'm particularly interested in subcultures and social media. Most of my articles are about Singapore, where I'm currently based in, but I'm interested in issues related to East Asia and Southeast Asia in general.</p>

<p>Sometimes I write at <a href="http://verytravelmuchbroke.wordpress.com" target="new">a more casual space</a> on the internet.</p>

<p>I am fluent in English and Mandarin, used to learn French, and am learning Japanese and Korean.</p> 

<p>When not writing, I can be found at the dance studio, practising ollies, running, planning my next trip, learning some game dev, or dabbling in other creative pursuits.</p>
=======
<p>My broad interests lie in documenting and understanding people, places, and experiences; my specific interests lie mainly in culture, current affairs, and the arts. I also love travelling and often archive my experiences, <a href="http://verytravelmuchbroke.wordpress.com" target="new">though they arenâ€™t always very linear</a>. In a previous life, I was an aspiring academic. My experience with the rigour of research informs my work today, and I very much enjoy working on stories that require more in-depth investigation. Currently, I am especially interested in issues related to East Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>I am fluent in English and Mandarin, used to learn French, and am currently learning Japanese and Korean. When not writing, I can be found at dance practice, skateboarding, running, reading, planning my next trip, or dabbling in other creative pursuits.</p>
