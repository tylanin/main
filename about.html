<p>The world is exciting. I seek to understand it through honest reporting, insightful analysis, and the power of narrative. To me, thoughtful journalism brings people together and lets us fully engage with our world.</p>

<p>I have freelanced for various publications, both Singaporean and non-Singaporean, and have experience in various genres, most notably feature writing, creative non-fiction, and academic writing.</p>

<p>My broad interests lie in documenting and understanding people, places, and experiences; my specific interests lie mainly in culture, identity, current affairs, and art. I also love travelling and often archive my experiences, <a href="http://verytravelmuchbroke.wordpress.com" target="new">though they arenâ€™t always very linear</a>. Currently, I am especially interested in issues related to East Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>I am fluent in English and Mandarin, used to learn French, and am currently learning Japanese and Korean. When not writing, I can usually be found at dance practice, skateboarding, running in the forest, reading a book, or planning my next trip.</p>
